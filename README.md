# backbone-sticky-notes
This is a backbone single-page app similar in functionality to the Windows Sticky Note application. The app requires no login--
everything is persisted in localstorage.

## Installation
Simply clone the repo anywhere you'd like:
```
git clone https://github.com/master-chu/backbone-sticky-notes.git
```
Then, just open `app/index.html` in a browser, and you'll have your own local version of the app running.
